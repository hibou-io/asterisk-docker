# Asterisk voicemail attachment conversion script 
# Revision history :
# 22/11/2010 - V1.0 - Creation by N. Bernaerts
# 07/02/2012 - V1.1 - Add handling of mails without attachment (thanks to Paul Thompson)
# 01/05/2012 - V1.2 - Use mktemp, pushd & popd
# 08/05/2012 - V1.3 - Change mp3 compression to CBR to solve some smartphone compatibility (thanks to Luca Mancino)
# 01/08/2012 - V1.4 - Add PATH definition to avoid any problem (thanks to Christopher Wolff)
